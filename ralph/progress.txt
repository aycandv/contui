# Ralph Progress: US-013 Log Search and Filtering

## Status
- Total Stories: 4
- Completed: 0 (US-013-1 partially done - state management complete, UI rendering needed)
- Current Story: US-013-1

## Completed Stories
None fully complete yet.

## US-013-1 Partial Implementation
**DONE:**
- Added search fields to LogViewState (search_pattern, search_matches, current_match, show_search_input)
- Added search state management methods to AppState
- Added keybindings: '/' to open search, 'n'/'N' for navigation, 'Esc' to close
- Added handle_log_search_key method skeleton

**REMAINING for Ralph:**
1. Render search input field at bottom of log view when show_search_input is true
2. Handle character input for typing search pattern (update search as user types)
3. Highlight matching log lines in render_log_viewer
4. Show match count indicator (e.g., "3/15")
5. Ensure search pattern is applied to newly added logs

## Key Files to Modify
- src/ui/components/log_viewer.rs - Add search input rendering and match highlighting
- src/ui/app.rs - Complete handle_log_search_key for character input

## Notes
- Search is case-insensitive substring match (not regex yet)
- matches are stored as indices into logs Vec
- current_match is index into matches Vec
- When follow mode is enabled and search is opened, follow is disabled
